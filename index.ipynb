    "These notebooks were used to generate the figures shown in the abstract [\"Open source software for simulations and inversions of airborne electromagnetic data\"](Heagy_etal_2018_aem_workshop.pdf) and in the [presentation slides](https://speakerdeck.com/lheagy/open-source-software-for-simulations-and-inversions-of-airborne-electromagnetic-data). We perform a 3D forward simulation of airborne time-domain electromagnetic data over a vertical plate, examine the fields and fluxes, and then perform 3 inversions to recover the subsurface conductivity: (1) a stiched 1D inversion, (2) a 2D voxel inversion and (3) a 2D parametric inversion"
